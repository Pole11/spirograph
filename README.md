## General info
This is an easy to use (I hope) tool to draw spirographs. The code in sketch.js might seem long and complicated, but only because I added a lot of sliders, texts, and buttons, the concept is pretty simple.

## Technologies
For the animation I used:
* <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>

## Setup
To run this project, you can: 
* click on this <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Pole/full/QdQuBgD9K">link</a> 
* open it with the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Pole/sketches/QdQuBgD9K">web editor</a> of p5.js so that you can also modify the code
* use a live server (if you use VSCode you can use this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">extension</a>, or you can install <a href="http://brackets.io/">brackets</a> which is a text editor with the live server functionality built in)

## Explanation
To draw a spirograph, just play around with the slider, change the shape and the colors and then press the button with the ðŸ’¾ icon to save the image. If messed up and you want to clean the canvas press the button with the ðŸ—‘ icon.

The values p, r and R refers to the values you can find on this image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">Wikipedia</a>
